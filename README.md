## Foreword
This is intended to be a curation of resources for the new among the software testing community. It is not tailored to a specific area or role. Note that this is for all areas of regression software testing *after* the code in question is written.

Finally, I'm sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to add. Please read the [How to Contribute](https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page and **add to the list**!
